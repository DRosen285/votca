This will be the testsuite for votca-xtp

1) MD_FILES conf.gro and topol.tpr are necessary, the other two files are just for mapping, will be deleted at some point

2) QC_FILES has also the .com files for gaussian but nothing else. 

3) MP_FILES is created from the same .com files in QC_Folder

4) reset.sh files are only for testing and will be removed later.
