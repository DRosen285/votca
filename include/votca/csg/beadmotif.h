    /**
     * \brief Designed determine what kind of structure a beadstructure has
     *
     * Wants a beadstructure is created there are several different forms it can
     * have, this class helps to classify and break structures up into the 
     * appropriate sub class. The possible classes include:
     *
     * 1. Single 
     * 2. Line
     * 3. Loop
     * 4. Fused Ring
     * 5. Single Structure
     * 6. Multiple Structures
     * 6. Undefined
     *
     * The Single, line, loop and Fused Ring types are all elementary types that 
     * represent a fundamental structural unit. 
     *
     * Single Structure represents a type that has not been broken up into its 
     * fundamental components but consists of a single interconnected structure.
     *
     * Multiple Structures means that the structure consists of multiple 
     * structures
     *
     * Undefined means the structure has not yet been categorized. 
     *
     * Though the Beadmotif inherits from the Beadstructure its methods are kept
     * private the reason is that the type might be incorrect if an  AddBead
     * from the original class is called.
