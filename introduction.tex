Coarse-graining is nothing more than an analysis of the canonical ensemble of a reference (high resolution) system. In addition to this analysis, iterative methods require canonical sampling of the coarse-grained system which can be done using either molecular dynamics (MD), stochastic dynamics (SD), or Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. The latter are implemented in many standard simulation packages. Rather than implementing its own MD/SD/MC modules, the toolkit allows swift and flexible integration of existing  programs in such a way that sampling is performed in the program of choice. Only the analysis needed for systematic coarse-graining is done using the package tools.
