    <desc>
      Mapping file for analysis. Currently also during coarse-grained simulations, a mappin file has to be specified
      which is only a 1:1 mapping. This will change in the future.

    <name>non-bonded</name>
    <desc>
      Section for a non-bonded interaction. All sub-tags will be later on specified in 
      interaction.* since most of them are identical to bonded interactions.

    <name>interaction.imc.group</name>
    <desc>
      Group of interaction. Cross-correlations of all members of a group are taken into account for calculating the update.
        I no cross correlations should be calculated, interactions have to be put into different groujps.
