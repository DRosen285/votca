\section{Mapping definitions}
{\em Mapping definitions} describe how to map a single molecule from atomistic to coarse-grained representation. The mapping definition have only to be specified once per molecule. The file contains sections for coarse-grained beads, bonded interactions in coarse grained scheme as well as mapping matrices. 

\subsection{Structure of mapping file}
The root node always has to be cg\_molecule. It can contain the following keywords:

\input{usage/mapping_tags}

\subsection{Example - mapping file for propane}

\lstinputlisting[frame=single,caption=Mapping for propane]{usage/propane.xml}
