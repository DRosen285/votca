In this section our description follows an excellent analysis given in \cite{Noid:2008.1}

Mapping scheme is an operator, which maps an atomistic representation of the system onto a coarse-grained one.
Atomistic system is described specifying the values of the Cartesian coordinates $\bm r^n = \{\bm r_1,...,\bm r_n\}$ and momenta 
$\bm p^n = \{\bm p_1,...,\bm p_n\}$ of the $n$ atoms in the system. Since we want to describe our system on a coarse-grained level, we need to introduce CG coordinates and momenta, which have a strictly defined meaning in terms of atomistic coordinates and momenta. The physical meaning of the CG sites $\bm R^N = \{\bm R_1,...,\bm R_N\}$ is specified by a linear mapping operator
$\bm M_R^N(\bm r^n) = \{\bm M_{R1}(\bm r^n),...,\bm M_{RN}(\bm r^n)\}$

\begin{equation}
 \bm M_{RI}(\bm r^n)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{Ii}\bm r_i \, \rm for\, \it I = 1,...,N
\label{eq:mapping_scheme}
\end{equation}

Analogously, the physical meaning of the CG momenta $\bm P^N = \{\bm P_1,...,\bm P_N\}$ is

\begin{equation}
 \bm M_{PI}(\bm r^n)=M_I\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{Ii}\bm p_i/m_i \, \rm for\, \it I = 1,...,N
\end{equation}
All together those {\it N} functions is a linear operator denoted by $\bm M_P^N(\bm p^n)$

Mapping operator should satisfy a certain condition, related to translational invariance. If an atomistic system is translated by the vector displacement $\bm r $, corresponding coarse-grained system is similarly translated by the same vector. This imposes the following condition on the mapping coefficients $ c_{Ii} $:

\begin{equation}
 \sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{Ii}=1\, \rm for\, all\, \it I
\end{equation}

It might be useful to define CG mapping in a way that certain atoms belong to several CG beads at the same time \cite{Fritz:2009}.
In order to understand this situation one needs to define two special sets of atoms for each of the {\it N} CG beads. For each site {\it I}, a set of {\it involved} atoms is defined as:

\begin{equation}
 {\tt I}_I=\{i|c_{Ii}\ne0\}
\end{equation}
An atom {\it i} in the atomistic model is involved in a CG site {\it I} if and only if the atoms provides a nonzero contribution to the sum in Eq.\ref{eq:mapping_scheme}.

A set of {\it specific} atoms is defined as:
\begin{equation}
 {\tt S}_I=\{i|c_{Ii}\ne0\, {\rm and}\, c_{Ji}=0\, {\rm for\,all}\, J\ne I\}
\end{equation}

In other words, atom {\it i} is specific to site {\it I} if and only if the atom is involved in site {\it I} and is not involved in the definition of any other site.

It can be shown (see \cite{Noid:2008.1}) that a CG model will generate an equilibrium distribution of momenta that is consistent with an underlying atomistic model if all the atoms are {\it specific} and if the mass of the CG sites is chosen according to

\begin{equation}
M_I= \left( \sum_{i \in {\tt I}_I}\frac{c_{Ii}^2}{m_i} \right)^{-1}\, \rm for\, all\, {\it I}
\end{equation}

\section{Boltzmann inversion}
Boltzmann inversion is the simplest method one can use to obtain coarse-grained potentials~\cite{Tschoep:1998}. It is mostly used for {\em bonded} potentials, such as bonds, angles, and torsions. Boltzmann inversion is structure-based and only requires positions of atoms.

The potential is calculated by inverting the probability distribution $P(q)$ 
\begin{equation}
  U(q) = - k_\text{B} T \ln  P(q) ~.
  \label{eq:inv_boltzmann}
\end{equation}
%
Note that the normalization factor $Z$ is not important since it would only enter the coarse-grained potential $U(q)$ as an irrelevant additive constant.

Histograms for the bonds $H_r(r)$, angle $H_\theta(\theta)$, and torsion angle $H_\varphi(\varphi)$ have to be rescaled to obtain the volume normalized distribution functions $P_r(r)$, angle $P_\theta(\theta)$, and torsion angle $P_\varphi(\varphi)$: 
%
\begin{align}
    P_r(r) = \frac{H_r(r)}{4\pi r^2}~,
    P_\theta(\theta) = \frac{H_\theta(\theta)}{\sin \theta}~,
    P_\varphi(\varphi) = H_\varphi (\varphi)~.
    \label{eq:boltzmann_norm}
\end{align}
With bond length $\vec{r}$, angle~$\theta$ and torsion angle~$\varphi$.%
The coarse-grained potential can then be calculated by Boltzmann inversion of the distribution functions
%
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:boltzmann_pmf}
    U({r}, \theta, \varphi) &= U_r({r}) + U_{\theta}(\theta) + U_{\varphi}(\varphi)~, \\
    U_q({q}) &= - k_\text{B} T \ln P_q( q ),\; q=r, \theta, \varphi~.
    \nonumber
\end{align}

\section{Iterative Boltzmann Inversion}
In \ibi~\cite{Reith:2003}, potentials are refined iteratively. The potential update $\Delta U$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:iter_boltzmann}
  U^{(n+1)} &=& U^{(n)} + \lambda \Delta U^{(n)}~, \\
  \Delta U^{(n)} &=&  k_\text{B} T \ln  \frac{P^{(n)}}{P_{\rm ref}}
  =  U_\text{PMF}^\text{ref} - U_\text{PMF}^{(n)}~.
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\lambda \in ]0,1]$ is a numerical factor to stabilize the scheme.

\section{Inverse Monte Carlo}
\imc is a second iterative scheme. It additionally includes cross correlations. The potential update $\Delta U$ is calculated by solving a set of linear equations
\begin{align}
    \left<S_{\alpha}\right> - S_{\alpha}^{\text{ref}}= A_{\alpha \gamma} \Delta U_{\gamma}~,
  \label{eq:imc}
\end{align}
%
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:covariance}
  A_{\alpha \gamma} &=& \frac{\partial \left< S_{\alpha} \right> }{\partial U_{\gamma}}  \\
  \nonumber
  &=&
  \beta \left( \left<S_{\alpha} \right>\left<S_{\gamma} \right> - \left<S_{\alpha} S_{\gamma} \right>  \right)~.
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
and $S$ the histogram of the interaction. Here $S$ and $H$ from Boltzmann Inversion both mean the same, due to notation used in the original papers we keep these separat labels.
